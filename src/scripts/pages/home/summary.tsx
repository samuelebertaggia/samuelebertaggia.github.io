  <Section header="Summary">
    I have always been passionate about computers, technology, and the world
    wide web. However, more than programming, I love helping others. As a matter
    of fact, I constantly strive to help people achieve more than what, they
    think, they are capable of. Today, after several years of professional
    experience, success stories, and projects delivered, I am a software
    developer, with commercial knowledge and deep understanding of both
    front-end and back-end solutions. Therefore, because my career has been
    built, above all, while working in corporate and banking environments, I can
    provide value and expertise in many aspects of the development life cycle of
    enterprise software systems. In fact, I am used to apply solid principles to
    the creation of high-quality web services and applications, while leading
    diverse and dynamic agile teams into constructive and collaborative
    projects. One of my main objectives is to continually help high-performing
    cross-functional teams get to the next level, by encouraging frequent open
    communication and constructive knowledge sharing, consistently working
    towards the achievement of the most valuable outcomes. In addition, I can
    work in high-pressure and target-oriented contexts, always promoting a
    can-do attitude, while delivering products of excellence by following the
    highest quality standards.
